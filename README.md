## Description
    This generator has been created for the use of managers, allowing them to quickly input some basic information related to their team that will produce output that is easily viewable to them.  Once initiated the generator will ask for information through a series of prompts.  To begin, the manager is asked for their details followed by a prompt asking if they would like to fill out information for any employees.  If the manager selects to enter information for an Engineer or Intern for their team they will be presented with a series of prompts related to the role selected.  If they choose the option to not enter any further information, the prompts will stop and output will be produced based on the information entered.  The prompts for additional employees will continue until the option to stop is selected.
